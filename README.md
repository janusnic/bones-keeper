# Laravel Bones|Keeper

**keep·er**
/ˈkēpər/

noun: keeper; plural noun: keepers

- a person who manages or looks after something or someone.
- an object that keeps another in place, or protects something more fragile or valuable, in particular.

## Before You Get Started

- This package depends on a BaseModel, belonging to the root namespace, so that it can be referenced by `\BaseModel`. Your BaseModel class should implement your ORM of choice (by default Eloquent); we will use this to connect to the database.
- You must have at least 1 (one) user in your users table.

## Installation

To install bones-keeper package for Laravel 4.2.* projects (terminal):

```sh
composer require genealabs/bones-keeper:0.12.1@dev
```

For Laravel 5 projects:

```sh
composer require genealabs/bones-keeper:^0.13.8
```

And then add the service provider to your app.php config file:
```php
	// 'providers' => array(
		'GeneaLabs\Bones\Keeper\BonesKeeperServiceProvider',
    // );
```

Before we can get started, we need to update the database by running the migrations and data seeders:
```php
php artisan migrate --path=vendor/genealabs/bones-keeper/src/migrations
php artisan db:seed --class=BonesKeeperDatabaseSeeder
```

Now we need to make the assets available (for Laravel 4):
```php
php artisan asset:publish genealabs/bones-keeper
```

Now we need to make the assets and configuration available (for Laravel 5):
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=genealabs-bones-keeper
```

## Usage

### Error Handlers
You will need to add two global error handlers **above** the existing default error handler to manage when a user fails the permissions-check in 
/app/start/global.php:

```php
App::error(function(GeneaLabs\Bones\Keeper\Exceptions\InvalidAccessException $exception, $code) {
    return Response::make(View::make('bones-keeper::errors.unauthorized'), 404);
});
App::error(function (Watson\Validating\ValidationException\ValidationException $exception) {
    return Redirect::route('modelValidation')->withErrors($exception->getErrors());
});
```

The above uses the default error views that come with the package. You can customize these using your own views, of course.

## Components
### Ownership
#### no
Used to detect or allow access based on a "no"-access condition.

#### own
Used to detect or allow access to user's own items only. The $userId belonging to the item in question must be passed in.

#### other
Used to detect or allow access to other's items, this is basically the inverse of "own". The $userId belonging to the item in question must be passed in.

#### any
Used to detect or allow access to all items in question, ownership is not checked if the user's role is set to "any".
